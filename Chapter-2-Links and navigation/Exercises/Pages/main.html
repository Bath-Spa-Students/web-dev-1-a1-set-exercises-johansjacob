                    When an Interpol-issued Red Notice--the highest-level warrant to hunt and capture the world's most wanted--goes out, the FBI's top profiler, John Hartley (Dwayne Johnson), 
                    is on the case. His global pursuit lands him smack-dab in the middle of a daring heist where he's forced to partner with the world's greatest art thief, Nolan Booth (Ryan Reynolds), 
                    in order to catch the world's most wanted art thief, "The Bishop" (Gal Gadot). The high-flying adventure that ensues takes the trio around the world, across the dance floor, 
                    trapped in a secluded prison, into the jungle and, worst of all for them, constantly into one another's company.

                    <p>
                        During the 1st century BC, Roman general Mark Antony gives Egyptian queen Cleopatra three bejeweled eggs as a wedding gift. The eggs are lost in time until two are found by a farmer in 1907, but the last one remains lost for over 2,000 years.<br><br>

                        In the present, John Hartley is an FBI agent who investigates the theft of one of the eggs on display at the Museo Nazionale di Castel Sant'Angelo in Rome, along with Interpol agent Urvashi Das. Wanted international art thief Nolan Booth escapes with the egg but finds 
                        Hartley and the Interpol at his home in Bali. They arrest Booth but Booth's main competition Sarah "The Bishop" Black, steals the egg. Das has Hartley incarcerated in a remote Russian prison with Booth, believing he is responsible for the theft. Hartley suggests that he and 
                        Booth work together to defeat Black; if he helps Hartley imprison her, Booth will be the number one art thief in the world and Hartley's name will be cleared. The pair escapes from prison and heads for Valencia to steal the second egg.<br><br>

                        The second egg is in the possession of arms dealer Sotto Voce. They infiltrate his masquerade ball and fight Black in Voce's vault for the egg. Black reveals she is working with Voce and they torture Hartley until Booth reveals the location of the third egg. Black betrays 
                        Voce and leaves for Egypt, where Booth claims it is. Booth reveals to Hartley that he lied; the egg is actually in Argentina in a secret location inscribed on his late father's special watch, which once belonged to Adolf Hitler's personal art curator Rudolph Zeich. 
                        Searching the jungle, they find a secret bunker containing Nazi artifacts, including the third egg. Black arrives to steal it but the three are interrupted by Das and police. Hartley, Booth and Black escape in an antique 1931 Mercedes-Benz 770.<br><br>

                        Booth learns that Hartley is actually not an FBI profiler, but a conman, and shares the Bishop mantle with Black; Hartley and Black are a couple and work as a team. They had planned the entire heist from the very beginning, using Booth to take them to the third egg. 
                        Booth surrenders and they leave him handcuffed. In Cairo, Hartley and Black deliver the three eggs to an Egyptian billionaire as a gift for his daughter's wedding. They then double-cross him; Interpol raids the wedding and arrests the billionaire. Six months later, 
                        Hartley and Black find Booth on their boat in Sardinia. He informs them that he told Das about their Cayman Islands account containing the $300 million payout for the eggs, which Das freezes, leaving them with no money, in retaliation for leaving him cuffed. 
                        He also reveals that Interpol is on their way to capture them, and offers escape if they help him with a new heist, which requires three individuals to pull off. They agree and Das places red notices on all of them. The trio begin casing the Louvre in Paris for their next heist.<br><br>

                        Beginning in August 2020, there were reports that Netflix was looking to develop a sequel to Red Notice. In November 2021, Hiram Garcia announced that there were tentative plans for a sequel, 
                        stating that Thurber had officially pitched a sequel and that all creatives involved were optimistic regarding its development, while announcing that Netflix had officially told them that they were 
                        interested in continuing the film series. The producer later said that the potential sequel would include the trio of stars involved in additional heists around the world, while reaffirming that 
                        its development was dependent on the reception to the first film.<br><br>

                        Johnson celebrated the positive audience reception to Red Notice on his social media, saying that there was "more to come." Following announcements that the release set the record all-time viewership for Netflix, 
                        Johnson further teased a future film announcement. Thurber later said that if a sequel was greenlit, he intends to film two sequels back-to-back. In December 2021, Hiram Garcia once again discussed plans for a sequel, 
                        stating that the end of Red Notice sets up the story.<br><br>

                        By January 2022, it was announced that the two sequels are officially in development and will be filmed back-to-back. Thurber will once again serve as writer/director, while Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot will reprise their respective roles. 
                        The sequels will also feature a number of supporting cast, with an ensemble cast planned similar to the Ocean's franchise. Johnson, Hiram Garcia, Dany Garcia, Thurber, and Beau Flynn will return as producers. The films will be joint-venture 
                        productions between Seven Bucks Productions, Flynn Pictures Co, Bad Version Productions, and Netflix Original Films. The films will be distributed by Netflix. In October of the same year, it was announced that the script for 
                        the second film was finished, while work on the screenplay for the third movie is ongoing. In the same interview, producers Hiram Garcia and Flynn confirmed that the sequels are being developed to be filmed consecutively.<br><br></p>
