                        Beginning in August 2020, there were reports that Netflix was looking to develop a sequel to Red Notice. In November 2021, Hiram Garcia announced that there were tentative plans for a sequel, 
                        stating that Thurber had officially pitched a sequel and that all creatives involved were optimistic regarding its development, while announcing that Netflix had officially told them that they were 
                        interested in continuing the film series. The producer later said that the potential sequel would include the trio of stars involved in additional heists around the world, while reaffirming that 
                        its development was dependent on the reception to the first film.<br><br>

                        Johnson celebrated the positive audience reception to Red Notice on his social media, saying that there was "more to come." Following announcements that the release set the record all-time viewership for Netflix, 
                        Johnson further teased a future film announcement. Thurber later said that if a sequel was greenlit, he intends to film two sequels back-to-back. In December 2021, Hiram Garcia once again discussed plans for a sequel, 
                        stating that the end of Red Notice sets up the story.<br><br>

                        By January 2022, it was announced that the two sequels are officially in development and will be filmed back-to-back. Thurber will once again serve as writer/director, while Johnson, Reynolds, and Gadot will reprise their respective roles. 
                        The sequels will also feature a number of supporting cast, with an ensemble cast planned similar to the Ocean's franchise. Johnson, Hiram Garcia, Dany Garcia, Thurber, and Beau Flynn will return as producers. The films will be joint-venture 
                        productions between Seven Bucks Productions, Flynn Pictures Co, Bad Version Productions, and Netflix Original Films. The films will be distributed by Netflix. In October of the same year, it was announced that the script for 
                        the second film was finished, while work on the screenplay for the third movie is ongoing. In the same interview, producers Hiram Garcia and Flynn confirmed that the sequels are being developed to be filmed consecutively.<br><br>
